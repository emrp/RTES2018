# RTES2018 - Intrusion Detection System

This Github page contains the codebase and documentation for the project "Intrusion Detection System" which uses 
- a [PIR sensor board](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-PIR_Motion_Sensor/), 
- an [MPU-9250](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-IMU_10DOF/) sensor board with a 3-axis accelerometer, 
- an [Adafruit Feather M0 RFM95 LoRa Radio (900MHz)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3178) board 

to detect motion and transmit an 'intrusion detected' packet to the [TTN cloud service](http://console.thethingsnetwork.org/). 
A small Python script is also available on this repository for you to fetch data from the TTN server to your computer.
